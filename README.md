## Hi there! 👋

I'm Arpon, a Computer Science graduate on paper and a traveler at heart. I am currently working as Reaserch Assistant at AMIR Lab. Here you'll find some of the projects I've been working on.

## About Me

- 🎓 I graduated from NIT Trichy, India, because of which I stayed in South India for 4 years. I am originally from Bangladesh.
- 💻 I find joy in problem-solving and playing around with AI/ML tech stacks. I spend most of my free time roaming around on problem solving websites.
- 🌱 Outside work, I love to travel, write, explore new food spots and clicking pictures. (You will find a gallery on my [website](https://arpon-kapuria.github.io/gallery)
